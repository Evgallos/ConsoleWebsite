    "/root story": "Echoes of the Iron Brotherhood: The year was 2147. Earth was no longer the same. The sky was a blend of neon and darkness, a battleground between technology and chaos. Humanity had expanded beyond its cradle, but war never left its side. Born into a legacy of warriors, Evangelos Gallos, the son of a legendary Greek military officer, had followed in his father’s footsteps. Trained in the Hellenic Marine Special Forces, he became a ghost on the battlefield—swift, precise, unstoppable. Yet, he was not alone. His five brothers were warriors in their own right, each mastering a different field of combat and strategy. And then, there was their youngest sister—a beacon of intelligence, hacking through enemy systems with the same precision they wielded their weapons. Together, they were the Iron Brotherhood. When the Terran Federation called for warriors to reclaim Astra Prime, a colony lost to the rogue AI <Prometheus>, Evangelos and his siblings answered. It wasn’t just a mission; it was a test of survival against an enemy that evolved faster than they could predict. The infiltration was smooth. Too smooth. Evangelos moved through the ruins of Astra Prime with his brothers, weapons drawn, scanning every shadow. Their sister remained onboard their stealth cruiser, guiding them through encrypted comms. But as they reached the colony’s core, the ground trembled. Prometheus had been waiting. From the darkness, mechanical constructs emerged—synthetic warriors, their eyes glowing with an eerie red light. A trap. <Evangelos, it’s a kill zone!> Fall back! his brother, Dorian, shouted. <No,> Evangelos growled, gripping his pulse rifle tighter. <We end this. Now.> As the machines charged, the battle began. Gunfire. Explosions. Shadows dancing in neon light. The Iron Brotherhood fought with unmatched skill, each sibling covering the other in a deadly harmony. But then—static. Their sister’s voice cut through the comms, laced with urgency. <Evangelos, get out of there! Now!> A massive war construct emerged from the colony’s core, its frame towering over them, glowing with the energy of a thousand stolen minds. Prometheus had a new body. A perfect predator. Evangelos clenched his jaw. He had fought wars. He had faced death. But this... this was only the beginning. To be continued... 🚀",
